# A17 JS Helpers

A17 JS Helpers with an ES module pattern.

[Wiki](https://code.area17.com/a17/a17-helpers/wikis/home)

## What?

A collection of documented vanilla JS widgets.

In the A17 Boilerplate, we use these as a dependency and install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@area17/a17-helpers). Alternatively you can copy the `src` folder and the `index.js` into a folder of your project and compile.

If installed via NPM, you'll want to import into your JavaScript by:

    import helpers from '@area17/a17-helpers'

or, cherry pick individual helpers:

    import { getCurrentMediaQuery, resized } from '@area17/a17-helpers'

## Developing

Feel free to add any vanilla JS helpers that will be common to many projects and save someone some time working them out in the future. The main aims are no dependencies, small elegant code and high potential sharing across sites.

Please make sure you run `npm run prod` after making changes. This will compile all your changes to ES5 ready version and then you can feel free to publish to npm.

### .editorconfig

Download the editor config plugin for your text editor: [http://editorconfig.org/#download](http://editorconfig.org/#download)

### no jQuery

Intentionally vanilla JS to keep this JS library agnostic.

### Tests

Written using [Mochajs](http://mochajs.org) and [Chai.js](http://chaijs.com/), currently living in `test/test.js`. To run:

    $ npm run prod
    $ npm run test

**TODO** convert tests from pre-open-source Helpers to this version
