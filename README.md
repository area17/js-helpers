# A17 JS Helpers

A17 JS Helpers with an ES module pattern.

[Wiki](https://code.area17.com/a17/a17-helpers/wikis/home)

## What?

A collection of documented vanilla JS widgets.

In the A17 Boilerplate, we use these as a dependency and install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@area17/a17-helpers). Alternatively you can copy the `src` folder and the `index.js` into a folder of your project and compile.

If installed via NPM, you'll want to import into your JavaScript by:

    import helpers from '@area17/a17-helpers'

or, cherry pick individual helpers:

    import { getCurrentMediaQuery, resized } from '@area17/a17-helpers'

If your project as Babel or any Javascript compiler, for smaller builds you should import helpers individually:

    import ios100vhFix from '@area17/a17-helpers/src/utility/ios100vhFix'

### Note

From v2.0.0 onwards drops IE11 support but maintains Safari 10+, Edge 12+, Chrome 24+ and FireFox 29+ support. If you need IE11 support use v1.0.3 and if you need IE9 level support, use v0.8.4.

## Developing

Feel free to add any vanilla JS helpers that will be common to many projects and save someone some time working them out in the future. The main aims are no dependencies, small elegant code and high potential sharing across sites.

Please make sure you run `npm run prod` after making changes. This will compile all your changes to ES5 ready version and then you can feel free to publish to npm.

### .editorconfig

Download the editor config plugin for your text editor: [http://editorconfig.org/#download](http://editorconfig.org/#download)

### Tests

Written using [Mochajs](http://mochajs.org) and [Chai.js](http://chaijs.com/), currently living in `test/test.js`. To run:

    $ npm run prod
    $ npm run test

**TODO** convert tests from pre-open-source Helpers to this version

### To add/update a helper

* Make your changes

* Test it, you may need to update the tests in /test/
* Update the [wiki](https://code.area17.com/a17/a17-helpers/wikis/home) document for it if required
* Tell engineering-fe Slack room
* Have a üç¶

## Update Log

**2.1.3**

**2.1.2**
* `queryStringHandler` : dont replace plus signs from query strings

**2.1.1**

**2.0.2**
* `resized` helper updated to capture current media query being `""`

**2.0.1**
* updates `isBreakpoint` breakpoints to use shorthand breakpoint names: `'xs', 'md', 'lg', 'xl', 'xxl'` (in line with A17 boilerplate 7.1.0 and A17 Tailwind plugins)

**2.0.0**
* removes deprecated and useless utilities:
  * forEach gone (just use native [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach))
  * scrollToY (just use [native with options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollTo))
  * triggerCustomEvent (use native: `node.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('event:name', { detail: { foo: 'bar' } }));`)
* adds:
  * `ios100vhFix` - adds a `--1vh` CSS var to the `:root` for CSS usage to counter iOS frustrating 100vh change when the browser chrome disappears
  * `responsiveImageUpdate` - updates image `sizes` attribute on resized to make Safari recalc which source to use from the `srcset`
  * `manageBehaviors` and `createBehavior` from the boilerplate to create and manage behaviors, this version has the initial data bindings development

**1.0.2**
* `resized` sends its event to the `window` and not the `document` for backwards compatibility
